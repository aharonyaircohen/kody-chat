# Kody Preview Inspector (browser extension)

Pulls live context out of the dashboard's preview into Kody chat:

- **Pick element** — hover + click; selector/tag/text/attributes → chat chip.
- **Console errors** — the errors/warnings the preview has logged.
- **Failed requests** — the preview's failed network calls (4xx/5xx/threw).
- **Screenshot** — a picture of the preview, attached to the message.
- **Speed check** — load timings (TTFB/FCP/LCP/load) + slowest resources.
- **Record a test** — record a click-through → a Playwright test chip.

Console/network are captured by a tiny script injected into the page's main
world (content scripts can't see the page's own `console`/`fetch`); it buffers
the last 50 of each and hands them over on demand.

## Why an extension?

The preview is a **cross-origin** iframe (a Vercel deployment on a different
domain). The browser forbids the dashboard's own page from reading or clicking
inside that iframe. A browser extension is the one thing allowed in — its
content scripts run inside every frame, including cross-origin ones — **without
touching the previewed app's source code**.

## How it works

```
dashboard page ──window.postMessage──▶ content.js (bridge, top frame)
                                              │ chrome.runtime
                                              ▼
                                        background.js (router)
                                              │ chrome.tabs.sendMessage
                                              ▼
                              content.js (picker, preview iframe)
```

- `content.js` runs in every frame and picks a role:
  - **top frame** → _bridge_: relays between the dashboard page and the
    background. Inert on any site that never pings it.
  - **sub-frame** → _picker_: dormant until "arm", then highlight-on-hover +
    click-to-capture.
- `background.js` routes `arm`/`disarm` down to the iframe and the picked
  element back up to the dashboard.

The message-name contract is mirrored in
`src/dashboard/lib/picker/protocol.ts` — keep the two in sync.

## Install (developer / unpacked — works today, no store needed)

1. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`, `brave://extensions`,
   any Chromium browser).
2. Toggle **Developer mode** on.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this `extension/` folder.
4. Reload the dashboard tab. The preview toolbar's picker button activates.

Comet, Brave, Arc, and Edge are all Chromium and load this as-is. Firefox and
Safari would need a separate build.

## Publish to the Chrome Web Store (when ready)

1. Add raster icons (16/48/128 px) and reference them under `icons` +
   `action.default_icon` in `manifest.json`.
2. Zip the `extension/` folder contents.
3. Upload at the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
   (one-time $5 developer fee, Google account required).
4. The broad `<all_urls>` host permission triggers extra review — expect a few
   days and be ready to justify it ("reads the element you click in the
   preview").

Note: a website can never install an extension for the user — the store page +
"Add to Chrome" + the permission prompt are unavoidable, one-time, per user.
