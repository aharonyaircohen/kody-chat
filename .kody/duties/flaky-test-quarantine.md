# Flaky Test Quarantine

## Job

Watch CI retry patterns and escalate tests that repeatedly fail then pass on rerun.

## Executable

## Output

A flaky-test tracking issue when a candidate crosses the threshold.

## Allowed Commands

- Run the `flaky-test-quarantine` executable.

## Restrictions

- Do not edit tests directly.
- Do not quarantine the same test twice.
- One new issue per tick.
- Use CI history as the source of truth.
