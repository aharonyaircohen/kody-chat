# Kody Performance Review

_Cadence: weekly — delivery of owned responsibilities, not subjective quality._

Two of seven staff delivered this week: ceo (own report duty, real content but the engine is over-firing it ~3.5× daily) and kody (the only active kody-owned duty, `clear-empty-goals`, is shipping a real daily scan); cto, qa, and tech-writer all own active duties that remain silent for a seventh consecutive week, and coo / ux-designer stay parked with everything disabled.

| Staff        | Owned duties  | Delivery | Consistency | Signal | Grade  |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| ceo          | 2 (1 active)  | High     | Low         | High   | strong |
| coo          | 3 (0 active)  | —        | —           | —      | idle   |
| cto          | 4 (1 active)  | Low      | Low         | Low    | weak   |
| kody         | 12 (1 active) | High     | Med         | High   | strong |
| qa           | 3 (1 active)  | Low      | Low         | Low    | weak   |
| tech-writer  | 2 (2 active)  | Low      | Low         | Low    | weak   |
| ux-designer  | 1 (0 active)  | —        | —           | —      | idle   |

- **coo — idle:** all three owned duties (`duty-review`, `system-audit`, `task-memory-extractor`) remain `disabled: true`. **Effect:** none — operator parking, not a miss.
- **cto — weak:** `dev-ci-health` produced no state, no committed report, and no `chore(dev-ci-health)` commit in the window; the duty has produced zero attributed output in the entire repo history (307 commits scanned). The other three owned duties (`approval-gate`, `architecture-audit`, `pr-health-triage`) remain `disabled: true`. **Effect:** the 15m CI-health heartbeat on `dev` is silent for a seventh consecutive week; a broken `dev` build would go unreviewed.
- **qa — weak:** `qa-verify` produced no state, no PR verdict, and no `kody:ui-verified` / `kody:ui-failed` label in the window; no `chore(qa-verify)` commit exists in the repo at all, meaning the duty has never produced a refresh in its lifetime. The other two owned duties (`qa`, `qa-sweep`) remain `disabled: true`. **Effect:** the 30m verification heartbeat is silent for a seventh consecutive week; PRs can land without a UI verdict.
- **tech-writer — weak:** `docs-code` and `docs-readme` both still have `disabled: false` on paper, but neither produced a state file, a report, a commit, or a PR in the window — and no `chore(docs-code)` or `chore(docs-readme)` commit exists in the repo at all. The previously-noted cause (PR #61 closed without merging on 2026-06-06T20:39:06Z) remains the blocker, one week on. **Effect:** the daily doc-drift guard is silent for a seventh consecutive week; the on-paper enable is closed-as-abandoned rather than open-pending.
- **ux-designer — idle:** the only owned duty (`design-review`) is `disabled: true`. **Effect:** none — operator parking.

### Cadence escalations (engine, not staff)

- **ceo (strong, but over-firing):** `ceo-performance-review` fired 25 times in the last 7d against a `every: 7d` frontmatter — roughly 3.5× daily, or ~25× the stated weekly cadence (improvement on last week's ~45 fires/7d, roughly half the over-firing rate). The local working-copy state file at `.kody/duties/ceo-performance-review.state.json` shows `cursor: "seed", rev: 0` after many total fires, so the engine is producing report output but not advancing the duty cursor. **Effect:** the weekly review is delivered; the engine over-fires it ~3.5× daily and the cursor is stale.
- **kody (strong, but over-firing):** `clear-empty-goals` (the only kody-owned active duty) fired 22 times in the last 7d against an `every: 1d` frontmatter — roughly 3× daily (slight regression on last week's ~19 fires/7d, still ~3 fires per day). The latest report content (`clear-empty-goals.md`, 2026-06-06 22:42 UTC) is real — scanned 1 goal, found 0 empty — so the duty is not churning empty no-ops, but the engine is firing it ~3× more often than the frontmatter allows. **Effect:** the daily empty-goal sweep is delivered; the engine over-fires the duty ~3× daily. The `.md` frontmatter for `clear-empty-goals` still has no `staff:` line while the profile.json says `staff: kody` — fix the .md or remove it.

- Changes since last week: **no grade changes.** Cadence picture: ceo 45→25 fires/7d (halved, still ~3.5× daily); clear-empty-goals 19→22 fires/7d (essentially flat at ~3 fires/day). The four silent active duties (`dev-ci-health`, `qa-verify`, `docs-code`, `docs-readme`) are now confirmed silent not just for the past seven weeks but for the entire repo history — no `chore(<slug>)` commit of any kind has ever landed.
