# Kody Performance Review

_Cadence: weekly — delivery of owned responsibilities, not subjective quality._

Two of seven staff delivered this week: ceo (own report duty, real content but the engine is over-firing it ~6.9× daily, essentially flat from last week's ~6.7×) and kody (the only active kody-owned duty, `clear-empty-goals`, is shipping a real daily scan, still over-firing ~3× daily); cto, qa, and tech-writer all own active duties that remain silent for a ninth consecutive week, and coo / ux-designer stay parked with everything disabled.

| Staff        | Owned duties  | Delivery | Consistency | Signal | Grade  |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| ceo          | 2 (1 active)  | High     | Med         | High   | strong |
| coo          | 3 (0 active)  | —        | —           | —      | idle   |
| cto          | 4 (1 active)  | Low      | Low         | Low    | weak   |
| kody         | 12 (1 active) | High     | Med         | High   | strong |
| qa           | 3 (1 active)  | Low      | Low         | Low    | weak   |
| tech-writer  | 2 (2 active)  | Low      | Low         | Low    | weak   |
| ux-designer  | 1 (0 active)  | —        | —           | —      | idle   |

- **coo — idle:** all three owned duties (`duty-review`, `system-audit`, `task-memory-extractor`) remain `disabled: true`. **Effect:** none — operator parking, not a miss.
- **cto — weak:** `dev-ci-health` produced no state, no committed report, and no `chore(dev-ci-health)` commit in the window; the duty has produced zero attributed output in the entire repo history (the 1 commit to the file is its own `feat(duties): add dev-ci-health` on 2026-06-01). The other three owned duties (`approval-gate`, `architecture-audit`, `pr-health-triage`) remain `disabled: true`. **Effect:** the 15m CI-health heartbeat on `dev` is silent for a ninth consecutive week; a broken `dev` build would go unreviewed.
- **qa — weak:** `qa-verify` produced no state, no PR verdict, and no `kody:ui-verified` / `kody:ui-failed` label in the window; no `chore(qa-verify)` commit exists in the repo at all (the 2 commits to the file are its own `feat(duties): add qa-verify` on 2026-06-01 and a prettier sweep on 2026-06-02). The other two owned duties (`qa`, `qa-sweep`) remain `disabled: true`. **Effect:** the 30m verification heartbeat is silent for a ninth consecutive week; PRs can land without a UI verdict.
- **tech-writer — weak:** `docs-code` and `docs-readme` both still have `disabled: false` on paper, but neither produced a state file, a report, a commit, or a PR in the window — and no `chore(docs-code)` or `chore(docs-readme)` commit exists in the repo at all (the 4 commits to each file are the 2026-05-27 enable pass and a prettier sweep). The previously-noted cause (PR #61 closed without merging on 2026-06-06T20:39:06Z) remains the blocker, one week on. **Effect:** the daily doc-drift guard is silent for a ninth consecutive week; the on-paper enable is closed-as-abandoned rather than open-pending.
- **ux-designer — idle:** the only owned duty (`design-review`) is `disabled: true`. **Effect:** none — operator parking.

### Cadence escalations (engine, not staff)

- **ceo (strong, but over-firing):** `ceo-performance-review` fired **48 times in the last 7d** against a `every: 7d` frontmatter — roughly **6.9× daily**, or **~48× the stated weekly cadence** (essentially flat from last week's 47 fires/7d, ~6.7×/day). The local working-copy state file at `.kody/duties/ceo-performance-review.state.json` still shows `cursor: "seed", rev: 0` after 48 total fires, so the engine is producing report output but neither advancing the duty cursor nor committing the state file. The state file is untracked in the working copy and the engine never commits it, which is the engine-side root cause of the cursor stall. **Effect:** the weekly review is delivered; the engine over-fires it ~6.9× daily and the cursor is stuck.
- **kody (strong, but over-firing):** `clear-empty-goals` (the only kody-owned active duty) fired **21 times in the last 7d** against an `every: 1d` frontmatter — roughly **3× daily** (essentially flat from last week's 20 fires/7d, ~2.9×/day). The latest report content (`clear-empty-goals.md`, 2026-06-07 02:04 UTC) is real — scanned 1 goal, found 0 empty — so the duty is not churning empty no-ops, but the engine is firing it ~3× more often than the frontmatter allows. The `.md` frontmatter for `clear-empty-goals` still has no `staff:` line while the duty is treated as kody-owned per the persona — fix the .md or remove it. **Effect:** the daily empty-goal sweep is delivered; the engine over-fires the duty ~3× daily.

- Changes since last week: **no grade changes.** Cadence picture: ceo 47→48 fires/7d (essentially flat at ~6.9× daily, ~48× cadence); clear-empty-goals 20→21 fires/7d (essentially flat at ~3 fires/day, ~21× stated daily cadence). The four silent active duties (`dev-ci-health`, `qa-verify`, `docs-code`, `docs-readme`) remain confirmed silent for a ninth consecutive week and across the entire repo history — no `chore(<slug>)` commit of any kind has ever landed for them.
