# Kody Performance Review

_Cadence: weekly — delivery of owned responsibilities, not subjective quality._

Same posture as last week: three of seven staff own active duties, only tech-writer produced a fresh finding, and the cto/qa structural gaps (missing labels, silent PR-stamping) are unchanged.

| Staff        | Owned duties  | Delivery | Consistency | Signal  | Grade   |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| ceo          | 2 (1 active)  | High     | High        | High    | strong  |
| coo          | 3 (0 active)  | —        | —           | —       | idle    |
| cto          | 4 (1 active)  | Unclear  | Unclear     | Unclear | unclear |
| kody         | 11 (0 active) | —        | —           | —       | idle    |
| qa           | 3 (1 active)  | Low      | Low         | Low     | weak    |
| tech-writer  | 2 (2 active)  | Med      | Med         | Med     | steady  |
| ux-designer  | 1 (0 active)  | —        | —           | —       | idle    |

- **cto — unclear (unchanged from last week):** dev-ci-health is the only active duty (15m cadence). The `kody:dev-ci-red` label still does not exist in the repo label set; zero issues carry that label, and no `dev-ci-health.state.json` is persisted remotely. Same ambiguity as last two weeks: the duty is either polling and finding dev-branch CI green per design (not persisting) or being silently dropped. **Effect:** no signal mechanism distinguishes "healthy and silent" from "scheduled but never runs."

- **qa — weak (unchanged from last week):** qa-verify is supposed to stamp `kody:ui-verified` or `kody:ui-failed` on every delivery PR after running `ui-review` against the preview. Both labels exist, but a fresh `gh pr list --label kody:ui-verified/kody:ui-failed/reviewing-ui --state all` still returns **zero PRs** across the past week's ~30 merged PRs (#107, #114–#116, #121, #126, #127, #135–#139, #142, #145, #147, #149, #152, #155, #156, plus the 2026-06-07 batch). The `kody:cto-decisions` trust ledger that qa-verify's auto-merge shortcut reads is also still missing from the repo label set — zero issues with that label. **Effect:** the verdict→merge pipeline is still open-loop end-to-end; every recent delivery PR bypasses QA; the auto-merge branch is structurally dead until that label is created.

- **tech-writer — steady (unchanged from last week):** docs-code produced one fresh open finding this cycle — issue #153 (`Doc-coverage gap: src/dashboard/lib/runners/`, opened 2026-06-08 10:12, still OPEN). The earlier #125 (ui-verify) closed 2026-06-08 05:24 (~14 min loop). docs-readme produced zero new `kody:docs` drift issues — only #23 (May 30) exists, now closed. Either legitimately idle (no merged PRs touched a documented area without updating the doc) or stuck (no `data.lastCheckedMergedAt` cursor is persisted remotely, so the readme half is structurally unobservable the same way dev-ci-health is). **Effect:** the readme half has no way to surface its own quiet health; a cursor dump on idle would close the loop.

- **clear-empty-goals (unowned, unchanged):** active every 1d, but the duty frontmatter still has **no `staff:` field**. Latest run: `.kody/reports/clear-empty-goals.md` from 2026-06-07 09:53 UTC — scanned 1 active goal (`kody-state-split`, 5 open tasks #50–#54), closed 0. The 2026-06-08 14:34 commit on the same path is PR #156 (Goal 98 schema frontmatter landing), not a new finding. A new `goal:ai-company-orchestration-7-gap-plan` state file is untracked locally (`.kody/goals/ai-company-orchestration-7-gap-plan/state.json`) but the clear-empty-goals report has not yet incorporated it — next run will see 2 active goals. **Effect:** process gap from last week still open; likely owner is coo given their planning/audit posture.

**Changes since last week:** none — ceo, coo, cto, kody, qa, tech-writer, ux-designer all held their prior grade.

**Structural note (cross-cutting, unchanged):** of the 3 active duties this week, 2 depend on labels that still do not exist in the repo (`kody:dev-ci-red` for dev-ci-health, `kody:cto-decisions` for qa-verify's auto-merge branch). When a duty's own `gh label create` step does not run — or runs in a path that silently swallows its own error — the duty becomes structurally unable to deliver without surfacing a visible failure. The duty-review or system-audit could pick this up if/when enabled. Worth auditing whether the engine's label-create step is being treated as best-effort vs. fail-loud.

**Self-finding (ceo-performance-review):** the prior state shape (`{ cursor: "seed", data: {} }`) shows this duty is not persisting its closing block between ticks. The report file is being committed multiple times per day (4 commits since 2026-06-08 00:23), well above the `every: 7d` cadence — likely the engine re-fires the duty every wake because `lastRunISO` is never written. **Effect:** the "next run" readout on the dashboard cannot show a real cadence; the cycle counter never advances; the deltas are hand-computed from the prior report, not from state.
