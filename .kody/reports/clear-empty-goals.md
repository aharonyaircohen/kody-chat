# Clear Empty Goals — 2026-06-06 22:42 UTC

Scanned: 1 goal
Closed: 0 goals

## Goals scanned

| Goal | Tasks | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `kody-state-split` — Split .kody into config (dev) + state (kody-state branch) | 5 tasks (issues #50–#54, all open) | Not empty — no action |

**Result:** No empty goals found. All goals have associated tasks.

## Method

- Pulled the goal list from the goals manifest (issue #49, labeled `kody:goals-manifest`). The manifest JSON block lists one active goal: `kody-state-split`.
- Counted tasks per goal via `gh issue list --label goal:kody-state-split --state all` — returned 5 open issues (#50–#54, all titled `[kody-state-split] N/5 — ...`).
- Cross-checked for orphan `goal:*` labels not in the manifest: `goal:release-version` exists but has zero issues, so it is not an active goal.
- A goal is "empty" if it has zero tasks (open or closed). None matched, so no closes were issued.
