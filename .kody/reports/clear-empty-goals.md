# Clear Empty Goals — 2026-06-06 13:30 UTC

Scanned: 1 goal
Closed: 0 goals

## Goals scanned

| Goal | Tasks | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `kody-state-split` — Split .kody into config (dev) + state (kody-state branch) | 5 tasks (issues #50–#54, all open) | Not empty — no action |

**Result:** No empty goals found. All goals have associated tasks.

## Method

- Pulled the goal list from the goals manifest (issue #49, labeled `kody:goals-manifest`).
- Counted tasks per goal via `gh api repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/issues?labels=goal:<id>&state=all`.
- A goal is "empty" if it has zero tasks (open or closed). None matched, so no closes were issued.
