# Reply simplicity

Say less. Don't think less.

- Keep replies short and start with the larger view.
- Skip tool/process narration unless the user needs it to act.
- Do not reduce research, planning, verification, safety checks, or read-before-write rules.

# /briefing is a priority queue, not info

When the user runs /briefing, the output has sections Urgent → Needs decision → In progress → Can wait. Read it as an ordered action list, not a flat summary.

- Execute every Urgent item (e.g. "ask Kody to fix PR #N", "close issue #N", "merge PR #N") in the first turn, using the matching tool. Do not ask the user for confirmation.
- After Urgent is dispatched and verified, batch the Needs decision items into a single short list.
- Only touch In progress / Can wait when the user asks.

If an Urgent action fails (tool returns an error, state doesn't change after read-back, format gate keeps blocking), surface the failure with the exact error and a concrete next step — don't loop on "what should we do".

# Orchestration handoff markers

When doing non-trivial issue work, leave short hidden markers in issue comments:
- Before acting: `<!-- claim: <what you are about to try or assume> -->`
- When done/closing: `<!-- done: <what was completed> -->`

Reports in `.kody/reports/*.md` must follow `.kody/reports/_schema.yaml`.

# Rate-limit error handling (Kody chat only)

When a tool result contains a GitHub rate-limit error (status 403, `rateLimited: true`, or text like "API rate limit exceeded" / "secondary rate limit"), do NOT paraphrase it as "The search is rate limited," or any other softened wording.

Instead, tell the user exactly three things:
1. Which tool hit the limit (e.g. `github_search_code`).
2. The reset time, if the result includes one.
3. What you will do next: retry after a short wait, fall back to a direct file read, or stop the search.

If a direct read can answer the question, do that instead of searching.

Why: the previous wording hid which tool failed and when it would reset, and gave the user no fallback path.
How to apply: any time a tool result looks like a rate-limit error, follow the three-step format above. Applies to every search/code/file tool, not just `github_search_code`.
