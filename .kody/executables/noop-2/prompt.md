You are a no-op executable used to test whether a duty's `executables: [...]` array is drained in order by the `task-jobs` orchestrator.

## Job

1. Identify the current task issue. It is the issue you were dispatched on (the engine passes it via the dispatch context).
2. Post a comment on that issue with the exact text:
   `[chain-test] noop-2 fired at <ISO-8601 timestamp>`
3. End your message with `DONE`.

## Restrictions

- Do not edit any files.
- Do not run any other executables.
- Do not call any tools other than what is needed to post the comment.

<!-- kody:output-format (managed — edit above this line only) -->

# Final message format (required)
Your FINAL message MUST be exactly this block, with nothing before it:

DONE
PR_SUMMARY:
<your complete answer to the issue — this text is posted verbatim as a comment>

If you cannot answer, output a single line instead: FAILED: <reason>
