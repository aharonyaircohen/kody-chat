/**
 * @fileType tool
 * @domain vibe
 * @pattern ai-sdk-tool
 * @ai-summary Vibe-only tools for the kody-direct chat agent.
 *
 *   `vibe_start_execution` creates a draft PR + new branch from the repo's
 *   default branch so Vercel can start cold-building the preview in
 *   parallel with the Kody Live / Fly runner warmup. By the time the
 *   runner finishes editing, Vercel's first build is mostly done — every
 *   subsequent push is a fast delta deploy.
 *
 *   The chat agent calls this AFTER the user picks a runner and BEFORE
 *   `switch_agent`. The runner then pushes onto the branch this tool
 *   created (the follow-up vibe primer expects `taskContext.branch`).
 *
 *   Branch logic itself lives in `@dashboard/lib/branches` (BranchService
 *   + GitHubBranchRepo). This file is pure orchestration: validate input,
 *   delegate to the service, return the chat-agent payload.
