/**
 * @fileType tool
 * @domain kody
 * @pattern ai-sdk-tool
 * @ai-summary Kody-pipeline dispatch tools for the kody-direct chat agent.
 *
 * Each tool posts a `@kody <executable>` comment on an existing pull
 * request. The Kody engine picks up the comment and runs the matching
 * executable — same path the user would take by typing the comment
 * themselves. Mirrors the bug-tools / release-tools shape.
 *
 * These tools DO trigger the pipeline. They must only be called when
 * the user explicitly asks to run a kody command (e.g. "kody fix #45",
 * "have kody review this PR", "rerun fix-ci on the PR"). Each tool's
 * description repeats this gate so the model carries it through.
 *
 * Supported commands (PR-targeted, see kody2/src/executables/):
 *   fix         — apply fixes; bare = use PR review body
 *   fix-ci      — fix failing CI on the PR
 *   review      — code review
 *   resolve     — resolve merge conflicts
 *   revert      — revert the PR's merge commit
 *   sync        — merge the PR's base branch into it and push
 *
 * Issue-targeted dispatch (kody_run_issue): posts `@kody <executable>` on
 * an issue so the engine picks it up and executes the work — clone, edit,
 * commit, PR. This is the "execute the plan" handoff: the chat model does
 * research + planning, then on user confirmation calls this tool to hand
 * the plan to the engine for execution.
