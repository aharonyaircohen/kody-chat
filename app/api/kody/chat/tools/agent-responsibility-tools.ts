/**
 * @fileType tool
 * @domain kody
 * @pattern ai-sdk-tool
 * @ai-summary AgentResponsibility create-or-update tool for the kody-direct chat agent.
 *   Writes a `.kody/agent-responsibilities/<slug>/` folder via the same `writeAgentResponsibilityFile`
 *   helper the dashboard's POST /api/kody/agent-responsibilities endpoint uses. Metadata
 *   lands in `profile.json`; human-readable purpose and limits land in
 *   `agent-responsibility.md`. Resolves the slug from the existing folder when present
 *   (update) and from the title otherwise (create) — same tool, two
 *   modes. Mirrors the read-merge semantics of PATCH
 *   `app/api/kody/agent-responsibilities/[slug]/route.ts`: omitted fields are preserved,
 *   only the `body` string explicitly overwrites the markdown content.
 *
 *   The model should NOT call this on the first turn — it must gap-
 *   analyze and ask the user questions until the agentResponsibility is well-specified.
 *   It should call read_agent_responsibility_creation_guide first. For updates, prefer
 *   `read_agent_responsibility` first to surface the current profile + body before
 *   patching.
