/**
 * @fileoverview Tests for pickVibeRequestIssueNumber — the decision that
 * bridges the chat's task scope right after a vibe issue is created.
 * @testFramework vitest
 * @domain chat-plugins
 *
 * Reproduces the gap: when the page has just created an issue but the chat's
 * task scope hasn't propagated yet (selectedTaskIssueNumber === null), a vibe
 * turn would carry NO issue — so the server can't bind the hand-off and the
 * model's guessed number slips through. The fallback to the just-created
 * issue closes that window.
