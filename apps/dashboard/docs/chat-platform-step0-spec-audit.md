# Step 0 — Source-text spec audit (H9)

Audit of every vitest spec that reads chat-related component source with
`readFileSync` and asserts on source text, per
[chat-platform-phase1.md](chat-platform-phase1.md) Step 0. Decisions:
**RETIRE** (behavior is or will be covered by the mocked, token-free e2e
regression net — delete the spec in the same commit that moves the code in
Steps 2–3/5), **REWRITE** (real behavioral contract — re-pin as a behavior
test against the extracted module; re-pointing string assertions at new file
paths is forbidden), **KEEP-AS-IS** (asserts on files phase 1 does not
restructure).

**Summary: 18 chat source-text specs audited — 9 REWRITE, 8 RETIRE,
1 KEEP-AS-IS — plus 7 adjacent specs listed for completeness (all
KEEP-AS-IS, including the `kody-chat-live-session.spec.ts` exception that
moves unchanged with its module in Step 2a).** The REWRITE set clusters into
four future modules: the terminal plugin/registry (4 specs), session
persistence + rehydration (2), the send pipeline / transport adapters (2),
and one spanning send middleware (slash bubble). The RETIRE set is dominated
by DOM/layout assertions that the phase-1 DOM decision explicitly assigns to
the Playwright layers. Five decisions carry caveats (flagged inline below).

## Core audit set — specs that read KodyChat.tsx / chat component source

| Spec file | What it pins | Decision | Replacement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/unit/chat/kody-chat-no-auto-dispatch.spec.ts` | No mount effect or rehydrate branch ever calls `startInteractiveSession` (issue #134 — dashboard open must not dispatch a runner) | **REWRITE** | Behavior test against the Step-2b session rehydration module (`REHYDRATE_RESTORED` ordering) + the kody-live transport adapter (restore probes, never dispatches) |
| `tests/unit/chat/kody-chat-per-session-agent.spec.ts` | `SessionMeta.agentKey` shape + `setSessionAgent` guard + every KodyChat agent-change path writes to the active session, not the global default | **REWRITE** | Session store/reducer behavior tests in `chat/core` (Step 2a/2b); type round-trip parts already module-level and move with `chat-types` |
| `tests/unit/chat/kodychat-slash-command-bubble.spec.ts` | `sendText` `displayContent` contract: bubble shows clean slash text, model gets the expanded prompt | **REWRITE** | Send-middleware chain test (Step 4/5b: `expandSlashCommand` middleware) + core send-pipeline unit test (display vs model content); e2e complement: Step-0 slash-menu case + `page.route` payload assertion |
| `tests/unit/chat-org-scope.spec.ts` | Org scope forwarded to the kody route; org is not a session boundary; org pages stay in global chat UI mode; system prompt frames org scope | **REWRITE** | Transport-adapter request test (scope header/body) + session-scope test in the Step-2b persistence module. The `system-prompt.ts` assertion may stay source-text (file untouched by phase 1) |
| `tests/unit/chat-image-grounding-source.spec.ts` | Image turns suppress the hidden preview-context append (client) and the kody route adds an image-grounding rule (server) | **REWRITE** | Client half: behavior test against the core request-builder / kody-direct transport adapter (Step 2c). Server half (route.ts) may stay source-text — route is not relocated |
| `tests/unit/chat/chat-terminal-registry-brain-singleton.spec.ts` | Brain terminal is a semantic intent (not a machine id): per-chat-session singleton, no remount on unchanged target, stale-selection normalization, restore without Fly inventory | **REWRITE** | Behavior tests against the terminal-registry logic extracted with `useChatTerminalRegistry` into `plugins/terminal` (Step 5a) |
| `tests/unit/chat/chat-terminal-registry-refresh.spec.ts` | Restored Fly terminals are not pruned before chat sessions hydrate; status refresh is scoped per chat session; targets reconcile after image apply | **REWRITE** | Same terminal-registry module tests (Step 5a); the hydration-ordering half also belongs to the Step-2b rehydration-ordering contract |
| `tests/unit/chat/chat-terminal-surface-timeout.spec.ts` | Terminal I/O guards: bounded fetches, stale-socket write guards, input-ack before "sent", reconnect on stall, no reopen while restoring | **REWRITE** | Extract the connection/guard logic from `ChatTerminalSurface` as plain modules during Step 5a and pin each guard with behavior tests (fake timers/sockets) |
| `tests/unit/chat/terminal-checkpoint-ui.spec.ts` | Checkpoint capture/replay/auto-save semantics, no replay over live session, `/terminal` commands route through Kody first, toolbar actions | **REWRITE** | Behavior tests against the checkpoint-transport shims (KodyChat.tsx:430–465, named in Step 5a) once extracted into `plugins/terminal`; toolbar-placement assertions retire to the Playwright terminal layer |
| `tests/unit/chat/kody-chat-composer.spec.ts` | Two-row composer layout (issues #65/#131): input row = textarea + trailing send/stop icon; action row = Paperclip + VoiceButton + spacer; autosize; mobile Enter behavior | **RETIRE** | DOM layout is a Playwright concern (phase-1 DOM decision). Step-0 net: attachments, VoiceButton-mounts, send/stop-mid-stream cases; Step 3 Composer extraction gates on them |
| `tests/unit/chat/chat-header-icon-only.spec.ts` | Header "New conversation"/"Chats" buttons are icon-only with aria labels (issue #133), in KodyChat + SessionSidebar | **RETIRE** | `admin-chat-regression.spec.ts` already asserts header controls by accessible name ("Toggle conversations"); extend with icon-only + aria-label checks in Step 0 |
| `tests/unit/chat/kody-chat-bubble-tool-call-markup.spec.ts` | Tool-call markup stripped from assistant bubbles; markdown rendering delegated to MarkdownPreview | **RETIRE** | `chat-renderer-output.spec.ts`: "provider invoke markup does not leak into the visible chat" + "approval markdown body renders as formatted content"; strip logic itself already unit-tested in `tests/unit/chat/tool-call-strip.spec.ts` |
| `tests/unit/chat/kody-chat-renderer-runtime.spec.ts` | KodyChat renders generic UI atoms instead of renderer-block semantics | **RETIRE** | `chat-renderer-output.spec.ts` (the whole suite is this contract: cards, lists, checkboxes, lock-after-click, no client-side guessing) |
| `tests/unit/chat/kody-chat-refresh-selected-model.spec.ts` | Saved model pick survives refresh: restore waits for model entries; static agents restore immediately | **RETIRE** (caveat) | `admin-chat-regression.spec.ts` "keeps models, reasoning, and sessions" pins the outcome. Caveat: the wait-for-model-entries ordering guard is timing-sensitive — if refresh-restore regressions recur, re-pin the guard in the Step-2b session-restore module instead |
| `tests/unit/chat/chat-terminal-targets-source.spec.ts` | Terminal target selector never offers GitHub Actions | **RETIRE** | One mocked assertion in the Step-0 terminal-toggle e2e case: open target selector, assert no "GitHub Actions" option |
| `tests/unit/chat-terminal-header-style.spec.ts` | Terminal chrome uses Kody app tokens (not terminal chrome), scrollable history, no redundant footer status, restore blocks remote input, web links open in surface | **RETIRE** (caveat, split) | Visual/token assertions → Playwright terminal layer (Step-0 terminal toggle + Step-5a gate). Caveat: two assertions are behavioral, not style — "blocks remote input during restore" and "loads web links in the terminal UI surface" — fold those into the Step-5a `chat-terminal-surface-timeout` REWRITE module tests |
| `tests/unit/chat/terminal-image-mismatch-ui.spec.ts` | Brain image mismatch shows a non-blocking warning without a second apply action | **RETIRE** (caveat) | Playwright terminal layer. Caveat: no mocked Brain-terminal e2e exists today (`chat-terminal-live-ui` is live/token-gated) — Step 0 must add a mocked Brain-terminal case before this spec is deleted, else downgrade to REWRITE in `plugins/terminal` |
| `tests/unit/chat/voice-wake-lock.spec.ts` | `useVoiceChat` re-acquires the screen wake lock on resume/visibility-change (issue #148), deferred via setTimeout with a state re-check | **KEEP-AS-IS** (caveat) | Phase 1 does not restructure `useVoiceChat.ts` (Step 5e keeps voice in core, unchanged). Wake-lock timing is not e2e-testable. If the hook file relocates wholesale, the spec relocates with it — same pattern as the live-session exception, since it pins hook internals, not KodyChat |

## Adjacent specs (read chat-related source, outside the H9 core set)

| Spec file | What it pins | Decision | Replacement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/unit/chat/kody-chat-live-session.spec.ts` | The localStorage key/migration contract (`kody-sessions-v3:<owner>/<repo>` scoping, pruning, legacy migration, live auth headers, sticky brain chat id) — pure module test, no `readFileSync` | **KEEP-AS-IS** | Named exception in the plan: moves unchanged with its module in Step 2a. Complemented (not replaced) by the Step-0 golden-fixture persistence tests |
| `tests/rate-limit-polling.spec.ts` | Repo-wide GitHub rate-limit guardrails (polling cadence ≥ 15s, cached paths) across ~12 files including KodyChat.tsx and useChatTerminalRegistry.ts | **KEEP-AS-IS** (caveat) | Cross-cutting infra guard, not a chat behavior pin. Caveat: when Steps 2–5 relocate KodyChat/registry code, the polling code moves too — updating this spec's read paths is mechanical guard maintenance, not the forbidden "re-point a behavior assertion"; do it in the same commits |
| `tests/unit/chat/kody-chat-evals.spec.ts` | Prompt-policy evals (issue counting, clarifying-question limits) via module imports; two source reads on `app/api/kody/chat/kody/route.ts` (terminal-output tool required, show_view retry cap) | **KEEP-AS-IS** | The kody route is touched (Step 4 tool registry) but not relocated; assertions target loop policy the registry work must preserve |
| `tests/unit/chat/chat-defaults.spec.ts` | Server prompt bundle: capability/tool/skill/workflow consistency, prompt composition — module tests plus source reads on `app/api/kody/chat/tools/*` | **KEEP-AS-IS** | Server-side prompt bundle; Step 4's registry int tests (real route handler + fixture plugin) extend, not replace, this |
| `tests/unit/local-chat-terminal-session.spec.ts` | Local terminal session registry behavior (module test) + one source guard: no static `node-pty` import | **KEEP-AS-IS** | Server lib (`lib/terminal/*`), not a phase-1 target; the source read is a bundle-hygiene guard |
| `tests/unit/terminal-bridge-jobs-source.spec.ts` | Async job handling in the Fly terminal bridge script (`lib/terminal/bridge-fly.ts`) | **KEEP-AS-IS** | `lib/terminal/*` is server plumbing, outside the Step-5a UI-side terminal plugin scope |
| `tests/unit/terminal-session-route-wake.spec.ts` | Terminal session route waits for machine wake (`app/api/kody/terminal/session/route.ts` + `session-connect.ts`) | **KEEP-AS-IS** | Server route, not in phase-1 scope |

Not in scope (verified module tests, no source reads): `kody-chat-helpers.spec.ts`,
`kody-chat-types.spec.ts`, `terminal-bridge-runtime.spec.ts` — they move with
their modules in Step 2a like any import-path update. No spec reads
`ChatRailShell.tsx` source (the host contract is untested at the unit layer;
Step 3's injection → chip-renders test is new coverage, not a replacement).

## Genuinely unclear calls

1. **`kody-chat-refresh-selected-model.spec.ts`** — RETIRE assumes the
   admin-regression outcome check is enough; the internal wait-ordering guard
   has no e2e equivalent. Cheap insurance: re-pin it in the Step-2b module.
2. **`terminal-image-mismatch-ui.spec.ts`** — RETIRE is conditional on Step 0
   actually adding a mocked Brain-terminal e2e case; none exists today.
3. **`chat-terminal-header-style.spec.ts`** — split decision; two of its nine
   assertions are behavioral and must survive as Step-5a module tests.
4. **`voice-wake-lock.spec.ts`** — source-text style but pins a hook phase 1
   doesn't restructure; kept rather than forced into a rewrite nobody needs.
5. **`rate-limit-polling.spec.ts`** — path updates when chat code relocates
   sit in tension with the "no re-pointing" rule; treated as allowed because
   it is an infra guard, not a behavior pin. Flag if you disagree.
