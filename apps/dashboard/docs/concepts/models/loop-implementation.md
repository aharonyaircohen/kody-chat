# Loop implementation

Status: **Repository and Todo-derived Loops execute through the Engine scheduler**

## Dashboard

- Page: `/agent-loops`
- API: `/api/kody/loops`
- Validator: `packages/agency-domain/src/index.ts`
- Storage:
  `.kody-engine/definitions/loops/<id>/loop.json` in the selected GitHub
  repository

The Dashboard can list, create, update, and delete the simple Loop definition.

## Engine

Convex checks for due Engine work every 5 minutes through the authenticated
runner pool. The scheduler combines repository Loop definitions with temporary
Loops derived from active Agency-request Todos in Convex. GitHub Actions keeps
manual `workflow_dispatch`, but no longer owns the recurring clock.

- manual and schedule dispatch work;
- idempotency, capacity, leases, and Run recording prevent duplicate work;
- a failed Agency-request Workflow leaves its temporary Loop active;
- end-to-end Workflow success removes the Loop reference from the Todo, so the
  next scheduler wake no longer sees it;
- event-driven behavior remains owned by Triggers.

## Required integration

Repository-authored Loop definitions remain repository content. Temporary
Agency-request Loops are runtime state derived only from the owning Todo; they
are never committed to the repository or stored as a second state record.

## Live verification

The feature is complete only when a Loop created in `/agent-loops` fires in the
real Engine, invokes its real Workflow/Capability and LLM, writes a Run, avoids
duplicate firing, and appears in the Dashboard after reload.
