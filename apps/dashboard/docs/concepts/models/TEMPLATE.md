# Model name

Status: Draft | Reviewed | Canonical  
Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD  
Owners: Product | Domain  
Implementation: `model-implementation.md`  
Load when: Any task needs this model's meaning, fields, ownership, or relationships

## Meaning

One short explanation of the model and why no existing model owns this
responsibility.

## Owns

- Exact responsibility.

## Does not own

- Responsibility owned elsewhere.

## Boundary test

1. Question confirming data belongs here.
2. Question rejecting data owned elsewhere.

## Data kinds

| Part | Kind | Mutable? | Identity? | Lifecycle? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | Authored contract | No | Yes | Yes |
| State | Runtime State | Yes | References Definition | No |
| Event/output | History | Append-only | Yes | No |
| Value | Embedded contract | Through owner | No | No |

## Contract

### Definition

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Validation | Excludes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Yes | Stable identity | Exact rule | Storage/runtime data |

### State

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `definitionId` | string | Yes | Definition tracked | Existing Definition |

### History

Describe events, decisions, Facts, Evidence, Artifacts, and retention.

### Values

Describe embedded contracts with no independent identity or Lifecycle.

## Invariants

- `MOD-01` — Model MUST ...
- `MOD-02` — Model MUST NOT ...

Link implementation enforcement to
`model-implementation.md#enforcement-status`.

## Lifecycle

```text
draft -> active -> paused -> retired -> archived
```

| State | Meaning | Enter when | Allowed exits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Draft | Meaning | Conditions | Transitions |

Define semantic creation, change, retirement, archive, restore, deletion, and
reference-protection rules. Put current mechanics in the implementation guide.

## Relationships

| Model | Direction | Cardinality | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Related model | Incoming/outgoing | One/many | Ownership/dependency | Exact meaning |

Define revision pinning, missing references, cycles, shared ownership, and
deletion impact.

## Human and AI authority

- Human MAY ...
- AI manager MAY ...
- AI manager MUST NOT ...
- Human approval IS REQUIRED for ...

## Approved target

List approved semantic rules only. Put proposals and migration work in the
implementation guide.

## Examples

Include:

- smallest valid example;
- full valid example when useful;
- responsibility violation;
- invalid relationship;
- Definition/State mix;
- State/History mix.

Name the violated rule ID.

## Decisions

| ID | Date | Decision | Why | Evidence | Approved by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MOD-D01` | YYYY-MM-DD | Decision | Reason | Source | Owner |

## Open model decisions

List only decision IDs and short names. Keep evidence, options, impact, and
owners in the implementation guide.

Blocking questions stop dependent implementation.

- Domain contract:
- Implementation evidence: `model-implementation.md`
