# /init — engine install

`/init` (chat slash-command, or `POST /api/kody/engine/install`) wires
a consumer repo up so Kody can run inside its GitHub Actions runner.
One call, idempotent.

## What it does

In order, against the connected repo (`owner/repo` from the dashboard
auth headers):

1. **Pulls the canonical workflow** — `templates/kody.yml` from
   `@kody-ade/kody-engine@latest` on unpkg.
2. **Commits the workflow** to `.github/workflows/kody.yml`.
   - File absent → create (`chore(kody): install engine workflow`).
   - File present and matches latest → no commit.
   - File present and differs → update (`chore(kody): sync engine workflow to latest template`).
   - `force: true` always commits.
3. **Creates or updates `kody.config.json`** without replacing unrelated
   repo settings. If an engine model is configured in the dashboard, `/init`
   writes it to `agent.model`.
4. **Writes `KODY_TOKEN`** as a compatibility secret when the caller's PAT
   can manage Actions secrets. It is optional: the engine falls back through
   PAT, GitHub App credentials, and finally GitHub's built-in token.
5. **Makes repo vault secrets available to workflows.** Reads
   `backend vault record`, decrypts it with the dashboard's
   `KODY_MASTER_KEY`, and writes each entry as a repo Actions secret.
   This keeps older env-based engine paths working. Newer engine scripts that
   need repo-owned secrets, such as QA auth, read the encrypted vault directly
   at runtime when `KODY_MASTER_KEY` and `KODY_TOKEN` are available.
   - Names matching `GITHUB_*` or `ACTIONS_*` are skipped (GitHub
     reserves them).
   - Invalid names (anything not matching `^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$`) are
     skipped.
6. **Registers the dashboard webhook** at
   `<dashboard-base>/api/webhooks/github` so push-based cache
   invalidation works.

Secret writes, vault mirroring, and webhook registration are **soft-fail**:
their failures appear in `nextSteps` and `summary` without undoing the
workflow/config install.

## Verify the setup

Check the connected repo, not only the dashboard:

1. Confirm the repo contains `.github/workflows/kody.yml` and
   `kody.config.json` on its default branch.
2. Confirm the dashboard has an enabled engine/default model and that the
   model's API-key secret exists under **Settings → Secrets**.
3. In chat, select **Kody Live** and send a read-only request such as:
   `Reply with this repo's name and current branch. Do not edit files.`
4. Wait for Kody Live to become ready and return the answer. Then confirm the
   matching Kody workflow run completed successfully in the repo's
   **GitHub Actions** tab.

The files prove that Kody was installed. The completed read-only run proves
that the workflow, model, credentials, and dashboard event path work together.

## Repair a missing or broken setup

In the connected repo's dashboard chat, send `/init` by itself. The command is
idempotent: it creates or updates the workflow and config, refreshes compatible
repo secrets, and refreshes the webhook without replacing unrelated
`kody.config.json` settings.

Read the full `/init` summary and complete every item under `nextSteps`.
An `ok: true` response means the workflow/config install succeeded; secret and
webhook steps can still have soft failures. After resolving them, re-run
`/init`, then repeat the Kody Live verification above.

`/init` cannot invent an LLM model or provider key. Configure those in the
dashboard first if they are missing.

## Inputs

```
POST /api/kody/engine/install
Headers: x-kody-token, x-kody-owner, x-kody-repo
Body:    { "force"?: boolean }
```

`x-kody-token` authorizes the installer itself and must be a fine-grained PAT
with at least:

- `repo` (contents:write — to commit the workflow file)
- `repo:secrets:write` (optional, to set the compatibility `KODY_TOKEN` and mirror the vault)
- `admin:repo_hook` (for the webhook step)

If `repo:secrets:write` is missing, the workflow still lands and can use the
built-in GitHub token. Vault mirroring will be skipped.

## Outputs

```ts
{
  ok: true,
  workflow:        { action: 'created' | 'updated' | 'unchanged', ... },
  kodyTokenSecret: { ok: boolean, name: 'KODY_TOKEN', error? },
  vaultMirror:     { ok: boolean, written: string[], failed: Array<{name, error}>, error? },
  webhook:         { ok: boolean, created?, hookId?, error? },
  nextSteps:       string[],   // user-facing follow-ups
  summary:         string      // one-line human summary
}
```

## When to re-run

Re-run `/init` (or POST with `force: true`) whenever:

- The `kody.yml` template changes upstream (new engine version with
  workflow tweaks).
- You add or update a secret used by an older env-based engine path —
  re-running re-syncs the latest vault values to the consumer repo's Actions
  secrets. Vault-first paths such as QA auth read the current vault at runtime.
- The PAT is rotated and the previous `KODY_TOKEN` is no longer valid.

## Vault runtime access

The engine runs inside the consumer repo's GitHub Actions runner. GitHub OIDC
identifies the repo to Kody's backend, so consumer repos do not need a database
key. `LOGIN_PASSWORD` also does not need a separate Actions secret. Mirrored
Actions secrets remain a compatibility path for older engine code.

- `src/dashboard/lib/vault/store.ts` — `readVault()` for the mirror step.
- `src/dashboard/lib/webhooks/register.ts` — `ensureWebhook()`.
- `templates/kody.yml` (in `@kody-ade/kody-engine`) — workflow template.
