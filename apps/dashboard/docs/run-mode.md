# Run Mode

Run Mode controls whether Kody starts work by itself.

## Modes

| Mode     | Meaning                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `Auto`   | Kody can start this item without asking. |
| `Manual` | Kody must wait for approval first.       |

## Where users see it

Show Run Mode on the item the user runs:

- Loop
- Goal
- Workflow

If a loop runs capabilities through a goal or workflow, the dashboard should
show the mode on the loop and save the needed capability permissions behind the
scenes.

Capabilities do not need their own management page for this. They receive the
saved permission from the workflow, goal, or loop that uses them.

## Storage

Run Mode is repo-specific state.

The dashboard stores it in the configured Kody state repo:

```text
state/trust.json
```

The engine still checks capability permission at runtime.

## UI rule

Use icon-only controls:

- lightning icon = `Auto`
- check icon = `Manual`

Keep `Auto` and `Manual` as tooltip / accessibility labels, not visible row
text. Avoid showing trust history controls in the main row.
