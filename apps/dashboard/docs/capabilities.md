# Kody capability contracts

A **capability** is a reusable way the agency can produce a result. The canonical
storage is `.kody/capabilities/<slug>/profile.json` plus `capability.md`.
For the canonical model, see [`concepts/company-model.md`](concepts/company-model.md).

Capabilities are stored as one folder:

```text
.kody/capabilities/<slug>/
  profile.json
  capability.md
```

Kody chat creates capabilities with `create_or_update_capability`.

New UI/API work should create capabilities directly. Capability is the product
word. Older config and storage may still use `implementation`, but user-facing text
should call that the capability implementation.

## What a capability contract owns

A capability contract defines what reusable ability exists and how it is safely
exposed.

A capability contract owns:

- **Action name**: the public `@kody <action>` token that runs this capability.
- **Purpose**: what reusable ability it provides.
- **Cadence**: when this capability may run, if it is scheduled.
- **Agent**: which agent identity should run it.
- **Reviewer**: which agent identity should treat the output after it exists.
- **Output**: whether the capability only runs, or writes a report.
- **Safety rules**: what it may and may not do.
- **Implementation link**: the implementation slug, when the capability needs one.
- **Workflow link**: ordered capability steps, when the public action needs more
  than one reusable capability.

A capability contract does **not** own:

- A long agent identity prompt. Put that in `.kody/agents/<slug>.md`.
- A reusable action implementation. Keep that in the implementation folder.
- An agency reason or priority. Put that in Intent.
- Long-term progress. Put that in Goal.
- A long step-by-step runbook. Put reusable method in implementation skills.
- Long-term progress or scheduling for a multi-step run. Put progress in Goal
  or Loop; put step order in Workflow.
- Bash, Python, or API recipes. Put deterministic work in implementation-owned
  scripts, or method details in implementation skills.
- Raw state keys. Runtime state is engine-owned and not part of the capability
  authoring surface.

## Folder shape

Use this shape:

```text
.kody/capabilities/broken-links/
  profile.json
  capability.md
```

`profile.json` stores machine-readable metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "broken-links",
  "describe": "Broken link report",
  "action": "broken-links",
  "implementation": "broken-link-report",
  "every": "1d",
  "agent": "qa",
  "reviewer": "cto",
  "writesTo": ["broken-link-report"]
}
```

`capability.md` stores the human-readable purpose and limits:

```md
# Broken link report

## Job

Check the docs for broken links and refresh the report.

## Implementation

Run the `broken-link-report` implementation. Its skill owns the detailed method and
runtime state handling.

## Output

Write `reports/broken-link-report/runs/<timestamp>.md` in the configured Kody
state repo.

## Allowed Commands

- Run the `broken-link-report` implementation.

## Restrictions

- Do not edit source files.
- Only update the generated report.
```

Do not put metadata frontmatter in `capability.md`. Metadata belongs in
`profile.json`; prose belongs in `capability.md`.

## Profile fields

| Field         | Meaning                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | Capability slug. Must match the folder name.                                                                  |
| `describe`    | Human-readable title shown in the dashboard.                                                                  |
| `action`      | Public action token. `@kody <action>` runs this capability. Usually the capability slug.                      |
| `implementation`  | Legacy field name for the implementation slug. Use this when one implementation performs the work.            |
| `workflow`    | Ordered capability steps for one run, when the public action composes capabilities.                           |
| `every`       | Optional cadence: `manual`, `1h`, `1d`, `7d`, etc.                                                            |
| `agent`       | Agent identity slug that performs the capability. A capability without an agent should not auto-run.          |
| `reviewer`    | Optional agent identity slug responsible for reviewing or handling the capability output.                     |
| `mentions`    | Optional GitHub logins to notify, without `@`.                                                                |
| `implementations` | Legacy field name for a multi-step implementation list. Prefer singular `implementation` for normal capabilities. |
| `tools`       | Optional capability tool names exposed to the tick agent.                                                     |
| `tickScript`  | Optional deterministic script path for a scripted capability agent.                                           |
| `readsFrom`   | Context, report, or capability slugs this capability reads.                                                   |
| `writesTo`    | Report or context slugs this capability writes.                                                               |
| `disabled`    | `true` pauses autonomous scheduling.                                                                          |

## Run Mode

Capabilities can be `Auto` or `Manual`.

- `Auto`: Kody may start it without approval.
- `Manual`: Kody waits for approval first.

The flag is shown on the item the user runs. For a loop, goal, or workflow, the
dashboard saves the needed capability permissions behind the scenes.

See [Run Mode](run-mode.md).

## Output choice

The dashboard creation form has two output choices:

| Choice   | Meaning                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Run`    | The capability runs work and does not promise a generated report.                                                           |
| `Report` | The capability writes timestamped files under `reports/<slug>/runs/` in the configured Kody state repo and sets `writesTo`. |

Use `Report` only when the report file is the durable artifact users should
read later. Use `Run` for checks, dispatches, comments, or any capability whose proof
is activity/state rather than a report file.

## Body sections

### `## Job`

Say the capability's actual job in plain language.

Good:

```md
Find stale open PRs and create a weekly report.
```

Bad:

```md
You are a senior engineering manager...
```

### `## Implementation`

For implementation-backed capabilities, name the implementation and explain what
outcome it must produce. Keep the implementation details out of the capability
body.

### `## Allowed Commands`

For implementation-backed capabilities, list only the public action or
implementation slug.

Keep shell commands, API calls, and long run logic out of the capability. They belong
in implementation skills or implementation-owned scripts.

### `## Restrictions`

List hard limits.

Examples:

- Do not push branches.
- Do not comment on PRs.
- Do not edit source files.
- Only write the generated report run.

## Choosing between capability, implementation, and agent

Use a **Capability** when the agency needs a reusable ability, especially one
that is recurring or public as an `@kody <action>`.

Use an **implementation** when you are defining the method a capability can run,
such as a deterministic graph refresh or an agent workflow.

Use a **Workflow** when one public action should chain reusable capabilities,
such as `reproduce -> run` for a bug fix.

Use **agent** when you are defining who performs the work.

## Creation checklist

Before creating a capability contract, Kody should know:

- What should happen.
- Which public action runs it. Usually this should match the slug.
- How often it should happen.
- Which agent is the agent.
- Which agent is the reviewer, if anyone.
- Whether the output is `Run` or `Report`.
- Which implementation runs the work, if needed.
- Which workflow steps run, if the capability composes other capabilities.
- Which reports or context entries it reads or writes, if any.
- Which actions are forbidden.

If any of those are unclear, Kody should ask before creating the capability.
