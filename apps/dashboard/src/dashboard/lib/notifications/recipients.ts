 * @fileType utility

 * @ai-summary The single answer to "who should this event notify?". Every
 *   recipient decision used to be smeared across the dispatchers — the mention
 *   scrape lived in `mention-dispatch`, the channel-broadcast subscriber filter
 *   lived inline next to it, each re-deciding who gets pinged. This module owns
 *   it: `resolveRecipients(event, subscriptions)` returns the human logins to
 *   notify, applying the two recipient policies the dashboard has —
 *
 *     • mention-gated (the default): humans `@mentioned` in the body. Mentions
 *       inside code spans are ignored (GitHub doesn't notify for those) and the
 *       bot's own command handle (`@kody`/`@kodyade`) is never a recipient —
 *       otherwise orchestrator trigger comments (`@kody sync --pr 12`) and
 *       quoted commands flood the inbox.
 *     • channel broadcast (a `#`-titled discussion): every subscriber except
 *       the author, honoring each one's `channelNotify` preference.
 *
 *   Pure and side-effect free → unit-tested in isolation.
