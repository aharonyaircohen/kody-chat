/**
 * @fileType module

 * @ai-summary Agency Runs page-plugin (phase 2 step 4 — tasks-pilot recipe).

 *   shell renders in place of the raw route children; the route keeps
 *   rendering the same component, so with the chat-first toggle OFF
 *   nothing changes anywhere. Server half intentionally absent (honest
