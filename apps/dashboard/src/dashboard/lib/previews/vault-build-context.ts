 *   baked into a preview image and which Dockerfile variant the builder
 *   uses. Trap: `NEVER_PASS_TO_BUILD` strips Fly infra creds and the
 *   master key BEFORE secrets reach the build — extending the safe set
 *   silently leaks a credential into a public `*.fly.dev` image.
 *   Always re-check this list when adding a new infra-shaped secret.
 *
 * Shared vault read for preview builds. Used by both the per-PR
 * `createPreview` path and the base-image rebuild path so they bake
 * the same secrets + obey the same build-mode toggle.
 *
 * Returns a safe fallback (empty env + prod mode) when the vault is
 * absent, unreadable, or no background token is available. Callers
 * never need to special-case those.
