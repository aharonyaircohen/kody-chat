# Agents & AgentResponsibilities

The dashboard's autonomous-work model has three related concepts:

- **Agents** - `.kody/agents/<slug>.md`. A agent: who an actor is
  (character, values, doctrine). No work, no schedule, no commands owned by a
  recurring job. Edited on the `/agent` page.
- **AgentResponsibilities** - `.kody/agent-responsibilities/<slug>/`. A scheduled job: why the work exists,
  what outcome it maintains, how often it may run, and which agent agent runs
  it. Edited on the `/agent-responsibilities` page.
- **AgentActions** - `.kody/agent-actions/<slug>/`. The implementation a agentResponsibility can
  run: instructions, skills, scripts, tool wiring, and output contract.

A agentResponsibility folder always contains:

```text
.kody/agent-responsibilities/<slug>/
  profile.json
  agent-responsibility.md
```

`profile.json` is the machine-readable contract. `agent-responsibility.md` is the
human-readable purpose and limits. The engine's scheduler enumerates agentResponsibility
folders, reads `profile.json`, and ticks each due agentResponsibility.

## Why agent = identity, agentResponsibility = job

This split is load-bearing, not stylistic.

The agent is injected ahead of the agentResponsibility at run time. Anything concrete in the
agent - a task, a domain, a verb, an output format, a cadence - would silently
apply to every agentResponsibility that names that agent member. A `cto.md` that said "review
open PRs" would drag PR-review framing into a `cto`-run security sweep.

Keeping the agent to identity and values makes it composable. The same `cto`
can run a security audit, a changelog check, or a dependency sweep because each
agentResponsibility supplies its own job and the agent only supplies judgment and voice.

So:

|                         | Agents (agent)         | AgentResponsibility (job)                 | AgentAction (implementation)     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Path                    | `.kody/agents/<slug>.md` | `.kody/agent-responsibilities/<slug>/`     | `.kody/agent-actions/<slug>/`     |
| Answers                 | Who is acting?          | Why/what/how often?        | How is the work performed?      |
| Owns the schedule?      | No                      | Yes, via `profile.json`    | No                              |
| Owns the action name?   | No                      | Yes, `profile.json.action` | No                              |
| Owns reusable method?   | No                      | No                         | Yes, via skills/scripts/prompts |
| Names the agent member? | No                      | Yes, `profile.json.runner` | No                              |
| Independently ticked?   | No                      | Yes                        | No, unless a agentResponsibility invokes it    |

## AgentResponsibility profile

The profile is JSON, not markdown frontmatter:

```json
{
  "name": "security-audit",
  "describe": "Security Audit",
  "action": "security-audit",
  "agentAction": "security-audit",
  "every": "1d",
  "runner": "kody",
  "reviewer": "cto",
  "mentions": ["aguyaharonyair"],
  "writesTo": ["security-audit"]
}
```

Important fields:

- `name` - agentResponsibility slug; should match the folder name.
- `describe` - human-readable dashboard title.
- `action` - public `@kody <action>` command owned by this agentResponsibility.
- `agentAction` - implementation agentAction for normal one-agentAction agentResponsibilities.
- `agentActions` - optional multi-agentAction list.
- `every` - cadence between auto-runs: `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `6h`, `12h`,
  `1d`, `3d`, `7d`, or `manual`.
- `disabled` - `true` makes the scheduler skip autonomous execution.
- `runner` - slug of the agent under `.kody/agents/<slug>.md` that performs
  the agentResponsibility.
- `reviewer` - optional agent slug responsible for treating the output after
  the agentResponsibility produces it.
- `mentions` - GitHub logins the agentResponsibility output should mention, without `@`.
- `tools` - optional agentResponsibility tool names exposed to the runner.
- `tickScript` - optional deterministic script path for a scripted agentResponsibility.
- `readsFrom` / `writesTo` - context, report, or agentResponsibility slugs that form the
  agentResponsibility's data contract.

The dashboard create form asks for an output type:

- `Run` - no generated report is promised.
- `Report` - one `.kody/reports/<slug>.md` file is the durable output, and the
  report slug is stored in `writesTo`.

A agentResponsibility with no `runner` should not auto-run. A agentResponsibility pointing at a missing agent
file is a hard error at tick time.

`runner` and `reviewer` are different agent roles: `runner` performs the agentResponsibility;
`reviewer` owns the result after it exists.

## AgentResponsibility body

`agent-responsibility.md` is markdown prose only. Do not add frontmatter.

Use the body for:

- `# Title`
- `## Job` - the purpose and outcome.
- `## AgentAction` - which agentAction to run, if any.
- `## Output` - the expected report/context/result.
- `## Allowed Commands` - usually just the agentAction, not shell recipes.
- `## Restrictions` - hard limits.

Keep reusable runbooks in agentAction skills and deterministic shell/API work in
agentAction-owned scripts. The agentResponsibility should remain readable to the user who is
orchestrating the company.

## How a tick flows

```text
engine cron
  -> agentResponsibility scheduler
     -> enumerate .kody/agent-responsibilities/<slug>/ folders
     -> read profile.json
     -> skip disabled/no-runner/not-due agentResponsibilities
     -> run the due agentResponsibility action
        -> load agent-responsibility.md
        -> inject .kody/agents/<runner>.md agent
        -> run linked agentAction when configured
        -> write activity/state for the dashboard
```

Key points:

- The scheduler runs no agent. It only fans out due agentResponsibilities.
- The skip gates are: `disabled: true`, missing `runner`, and `every` cadence not
  due yet.
- `every: manual` never auto-fires; the dashboard "Run now" button still works.
- Manual "Run now" bypasses the scheduler gate but the agentResponsibility still needs a valid
  agent member.
- Cadence state is engine-owned and stored outside the agentResponsibility folder's authoring
  contract.

## State files

Runtime state is not part of the agentResponsibility authoring surface. The engine writes it
under the state branch, and the dashboard reads it to render run status:

- `lastTickAt` - last visible run time.
- `nextEligibleAt` - next known eligible run time, when the engine provides it.
- `lastOutcome` - coarse result of the most recent tick.
- `lastDurationMs` - wall-clock duration of the most recent tick.

Users creating agentResponsibilities should not author state keys. State mechanics stay behind
the engine and dashboard runtime contract.

## Editing and manual runs

- `/agent` lists and edits personas. Agents create/update payloads take `slug`,
  `title`, and `body`.
- `/agent-responsibilities` lists and edits agentResponsibility folders. The dashboard writes
  `profile.json` and `agent-responsibility.md` together.
- "Run now" dispatches the agentResponsibility action for one slug immediately.
- Slugs must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`.

## A note on cron cadence

Three cadence concepts are in play:

- The workflow wake controls how often the scheduler gets a chance to look.
- `profile.json.every` controls how often a specific agentResponsibility may run.
- Dashboard relative-time labels mirror the scheduler wake only for display.

So the wake is only the outer loop. The agentResponsibility's own `every` value is the
important per-agentResponsibility throttle.

## FAQ

**Can a agent agent include the work it should do?**

No. The agent is injected ahead of every agentResponsibility that names it, so concrete
behavior would leak across agentResponsibilities. Put job intent in the agentResponsibility and reusable
method in the agentAction.

**What happens if a agentResponsibility's `runner` points at a deleted agent?**

It is a hard error at tick time. A agentResponsibility never runs without the executor
identity it declared.

**Can a agentResponsibility have no schedule?**

Yes. With no `every` value it is eligible on every scheduler wake. Use
`manual` for "Run now only", or a cadence token to throttle.

**Does disabling a agentResponsibility stop "Run now"?**

No. `disabled: true` only blocks autonomous execution. Manual "Run now" still
fires.

**Where does "next run" come from?**

From engine state, not from the agentResponsibility body. The dashboard displays it when the
engine has written it.
