 * PR-level labels for the auto UI-verify gate. Applied to PRs (not issues)
 * because ui-review is PR-scoped. Read by the dashboard to render a ✓/✗
 * badge and (eventually) gate the Review → Done transition.
 *
 *   kody:ui-verified — ui-review ran and verdict was PASS or CONCERNS
 *   kody:ui-failed   — ui-review ran and verdict was FAIL
 *
 * In-flight dedup reuses the engine's existing `kody:reviewing` label
 * (set by ui-review's preflight) — no new in-flight marker needed.
