/**

 *
 * Read-only status probe for the shared always-on LiteLLM proxy app on Fly
 * (`kody-litellm`). Unlike brain-fly.ts (per-user, provisioned from the
 * dashboard) this app is deployed out-of-band via `fly deploy` in
 * kody2/litellm-server. The dashboard never creates or mutates it — it only
 * reports whether it's up so the Settings card can turn "assume it's there"
 * into "see it's there".
 *
 * Lives in the user's own Fly org (same org as the one-shot runners and the
 * Brain app), reachable over 6PN at `<app>.internal:4000`. So the status
 * check uses the same per-repo vault Fly token, and is gated on Fly being
 * configured at all — see [[project_fly_optional_gh_default]].
