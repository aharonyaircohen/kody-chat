/**
 * @fileType utility
 * @domain kody
 * @pattern staff-mention-dispatch
 * @ai-summary Server-only sibling of `dispatchMentionPushes`. Turns any
 *   GitHub-backed comment that @mentions a staff persona into a one-shot
 *   `worker-ask` tick — so `@cto` works the same in messages, goals,
 *   tasks, previews, PR/issue comments, and reviews, from one place. The
 *   staff member's reply is posted back into the exact thread it was
 *   mentioned in. Never throws; logs and swallows so the webhook still ACKs.
 *   (`worker-ask` is the unchanged engine executable name; the dashboard
 *   feature noun is "staff".)
 *
 *   Why server-side (not per-surface client wiring): every listed surface
 *   is a GitHub comment under the hood and already flows through this
 *   webhook, so one hook covers them all and stays consistent for every
 *   newly-connected repo with zero setup.
