/**
 * @fileType utility
 * @domain kody
 * @pattern duty-failure-inbox-dispatch
 * @ai-summary Server-only helper that turns a failed duty run into an inbox
 *   entry for every operator — so a silent failure stops being silent.
 *
 *   Why here, not in the engine: a scheduled duty tick is fanned out from
 *   cron with no triggering issue to comment on, and the engine config has
 *   no `operators` list (that lives only in the dashboard's
 *   kody.config.json). So the engine can't @-mention anyone. But it already
 *   reports every tick — including `outcome: "failed"` — into the Company
 *   Activity log (`.kody/activity/<date>.jsonl`, committed to the
 *   `kody-state` branch by `appendCompanyActivity`). That commit fires a
 *   `push` webhook, which is our trigger: read the recent failed records and
 *   append one inbox-feed entry per operator, exactly like
 *   `mention-dispatch.ts` does for `@mentions`. The existing inbox watcher
 *   then syncs each operator's slice into their private gist inbox.
 *
 *   Idempotent: entries carry a deterministic id (`duty-fail:<login>:<duty>:
 *   <ts>`) and `appendInboxFeed` dedupes by id, so re-scanning the same
 *   records on a later push is a cheap noop. Never throws — logs and
 *   swallows so a feed-write failure can't break webhook delivery.
