/**
 * @fileType utility
 * @domain kody
 * @pattern report-push-dispatch
 * @ai-summary Server-only helper that fires a Web Push browser banner to
 *   every subscribed device when a Kody duty writes (or updates) a report
 *   under `.kody/reports/<slug>.md`. Unlike the mention spine
 *   (`mention-dispatch.ts`), this is **broadcast** — reports are produced by
 *   the system on a schedule and are interesting to anyone who's enabled push
 *   for this repo, not just whoever was @-mentioned (nobody is).
 *
 *   Trigger: a `push` event to the **default branch** that adds or modifies
 *   one or more files under `.kody/reports/<slug>.md`. State-branch pushes
 *   are ignored (state lives there, not reports), and pushes that touch
 *   anything outside `.kody/reports/` are a cheap no-op so this stays off
 *   the hot path.
 *
 *   Per affected report we send one push tagged with the report's dashboard
 *   URL so repeated updates to the same report collapse into a single banner
 *   on each device rather than stacking. Click lands on `/duties?tab=reports`,
 *   where the per-row "unread" dot makes which one is new obvious.
 *
 *   Never throws — logs and swallows so a push-fan-out failure can't break
 *   webhook delivery.
