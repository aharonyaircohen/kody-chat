 * it from the picker. That was wrong: when the user opens the dashboard, the
 * chat is in a "Live" state they didn't ask for, and the only way to know is
 * to scroll past the composer dot. The visible row now matches the actual
 * state, and a Live runner only starts when the user actually picks it
 * (or types and sends, which auto-starts a one-shot session per the existing
 * /interactive/start flow).
 *
 * Brain row: offer Repo Brain only when the repo has FLY_API_TOKEN *and* the
 * per-repo `brainFlyChatEnabled` toggle is on (Settings -> Repo Brain on Fly,
 * default off). Fly task *execution* is independent and still keys off
 * FLY_API_TOKEN alone - this flag is chat-only. Otherwise fall back to the
 * manual Brain (URL+key via Settings). Same single-slot rule as Live - one or
 * the other, never both.
