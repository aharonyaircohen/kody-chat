 *   @login: when a token matches an agent slug it dispatches an ad-hoc
 *   `agent-ask` tick instead of (only) notifying a person. Agent wins
 *   on collision with a GitHub login — the same precedence rule repo
 *   prompts use over built-ins (the more specific, repo-owned thing wins).

 *   feature noun is "agent".)
