/**

 *
 * A run is considered to belong to the task if any of these are true:
 *  - its `head_branch` matches the kody-derived issue branch (`{issueNumber}` or `{issueNumber}-…`)
 *  - its `display_title` exactly equals the issue title
 *  - its `display_title` references `#{issueNumber}` (with non-digit boundary so #8 ≠ #839)
 *  - its `display_title` contains the pipeline `taskId`
 *
 * The branch predicate is the load-bearing one — kody dispatches the workflow
 * with `issue_number` as input and works on a branch derived from it
 * (see kody2/src/branch.ts deriveBranchName), so head_branch is a reliable scope.
