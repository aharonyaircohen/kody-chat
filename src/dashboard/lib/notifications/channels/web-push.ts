 * @ai-summary Web Push channel adapter (SERVER-ONLY). Unlike Slack/Discord/
 *   Telegram — which have a single delivery URL per channel — a `web-push`
 *   channel fans out to every device that has subscribed for this repo.
 *   Subscriptions live in the per-repo push-subscriptions manifest issue.
 *
 *   On 404/410 (subscription expired / device unsubscribed) we prune the
 *   record from the manifest so the next send doesn't pay the same cost.
 *
 *   This file is imported only from `./send.ts` (server) so it can safely
 *   static-import `web-push` and the github-client. Importing it from a
 *   client-side bundle would drag Node built-ins (net/tls) and fail to
 *   compile.
