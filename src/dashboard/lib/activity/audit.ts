/**
 * @fileType utility
 * @domain kody
 * @pattern audit-record
 * @ai-summary `recordAudit(req, spec)` — the one call sites use to log a
 *   dashboard action. It (1) resolves the VERIFIED actor from the request's
 *   PAT (not the client-claimed login), (2) writes to the in-memory hot ring
 *   for instant reads, and (3) durably persists to the audit manifest issue.
 *
 *   All of (1)-(3) run inside Next's `after()` so the user's action returns
 *   immediately and is never blocked or failed by audit logging. The durable
 *   write sets the GitHub context explicitly (the context module is a
 *   per-instance global that is torn down once the response is sent), and is
 *   attributed to the acting user's own PAT so it spends that user's rate
 *   budget, not the shared polling token.
