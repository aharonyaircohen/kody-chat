/**

 * @ai-summary Pure: bucket an engine run into a coarse category from the
 *   trigger event + title. This is the honest ceiling of what the
 *   workflow-run payload supports — it does NOT carry the `@kody`
 *   subcommand (fix / fix-ci / ui-review / sync / resume), which lives in
 *   the triggering comment body. Per-action tracking needs the engine to
 *   stamp the action into the run; reverse-engineering it here would mean
 *   repo-wide comment scanning (breaks the rate-limit rules). So we stop
 *   at category, deliberately.
