/**
 * @fileType data
 * @domain kody
 * @pattern commands-builtins
 * @ai-summary Default commands shipped with the dashboard. Each entry
 *   becomes a slash command in the chat (`/<slug>`). Repo-defined files
 *   at `.kody/commands/<slug>.md` override built-ins by slug. Drop a file
 *   `.kody/commands/.disable-builtins` in the repo to hide every built-in
 *   without overriding individually.
 *
 *   `/research`, `/plan`, and `/issue` enforce the research-first flow
 *   the kody-live system prompt expects (see
 *   app/api/kody/chat/kody/system-prompt.ts "Issue creation: research
 *   before drafting"). `/issue` extends that with the executor handoff —
 *   after the issue is created the model offers to run it with Kody,
 *   gated on explicit user confirmation.
