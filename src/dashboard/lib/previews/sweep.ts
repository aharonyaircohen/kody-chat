/**
 * @fileType library
 * @domain previews
 * @pattern ttl-sweep
 *
 * Destroy per-PR preview apps that have outlived their TTL.
 *
 * Previews accumulate: every open PR (and stale bot PRs never close) keeps a
 * Fly app alive. Even when machines suspend they still cost rootfs storage,
 * and the app count balloons. This sweep enumerates a repo's preview apps and
 * destroys any whose oldest machine is older than `fly.previews.ttlDays`.
 *
 * TTL is opt-in: `ttlDays <= 0` (the default) sweeps nothing. The per-repo
 * BASE image (`kp-…-base`) is always skipped — it's the build cache, not a
 * preview.
