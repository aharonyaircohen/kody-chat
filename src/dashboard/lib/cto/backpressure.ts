 *   LLM re-counts every tick from a ledger — it drifts and over-posts. This
 *   module makes the cap deterministic at the one server-side write point
 *   (the webhook → inbox-feed append): a CTO recommendation entry is only
 *   admitted while fewer than `MAX_PENDING_CTO_RECS` are still undecided.
 *
 *   "Pending" = a feed entry that is a CTO recommendation (`ctoAction` set,
 *   resolvable to an issue number) whose `(taskNumber, action)` has no
 *   verdict in the `kody:cto-decisions` ledger. Once the operator
 *   approves/rejects, that slot frees and later recommendations flow again.
 *
 *   Non-CTO mentions are never gated — only CTO recommendation entries count
 *   against, and are limited by, the cap.
