/**
 * @fileType hook
 * @domain kody
 * @pattern cto-decisions-client
 * @ai-summary TanStack Query binding over GET /api/kody/cto/decision.
 *   Exposes the latest verdict per `${staff}:${taskNumber}:${action}` plus a
 *   typed lookup so the inbox can show a verdict badge instead of
 *   Approve/Reject once a recommendation was decided on any device.
 *
 *   `verdictFor` accepts an optional `sinceIso` (the inbox entry's
 *   `sentAt`) and returns `null` when the latest decision pre-dates that
 *   message — that way a dismiss the operator made yesterday on the
 *   `(PR#1574, sync)` pair doesn't silently stamp today's fresh sync
 *   recommendation as Dismissed. Without this gate, every periodic
 *   re-post of a sync/fix-ci/resolve rec on the same PR is inherits the
 *   prior verdict forever — that's the "auto-dismissed" bug.
 *
 *   Auth-scoped key (owner/repo) — the ledger is per-repo, same as the
 *   inbox gist. TTL ≥ 60s per CLAUDE.md rate-limit rule; `invalidate()`
 *   is called right after a local decide so the badge flips immediately.
