 *   CTO recommendation and, if so, extract the task number + the *actual*
 *   action the CTO named. The CTO worker leads every recommendation comment
 *   with `🧭 **CTO recommendation** — \`<action>\`` (see .kody/workers/cto.md);
 *   the inbox snippet has code fences stripped, so we match the prose marker
 *   and read the verb that follows it — never defaulting to `execute`.
 *
 *   Only `execute`/`fix` are *dispatchable* from the dashboard: both resolve
 *   to the engine's single write path (an `@kody` comment on the task — for
 *   `fix` the QA-failure comment is already in-thread, so re-dispatching is
 *   the fix). `qa-review`/`approve`/`comment` have no dashboard executor
 *   (per cto.md, approve is a human merge gate) — they surface read-only so
 *   approving can never silently post the wrong command.
