/**
 * @fileType utility
 * @domain kody
 * @pattern cto-recommendation-detect
 * @ai-summary Pure detector: given an inbox entry, decide whether it is a
 *   staff recommendation and, if so, extract the emitting staff slug, the
 *   task number, and the *actual* action named. Every staff member leads its
 *   recommendation comment with a prose marker (`🧭 **CTO recommendation** —
 *   \`<action>\``, `🧪 **QA result** — \`<action>\``, …) AND a machine-readable
 *   `<!-- kody-staff: <slug> -->` HTML comment (see .kody/staff/*.md). The
 *   slug line is the deterministic identity signal — it survives any persona's
 *   wording and is stripped from the inbox snippet (buildSnippet drops HTML
 *   comments), so the operator never sees it. Legacy recs that predate the
 *   slug line fall back to the CTO marker and default to the `cto` slug.
 *
 *   Only `execute`/`fix` are *dispatchable* from the dashboard: both resolve
 *   to the engine's single write path (an `@kody` comment on the task — for
 *   `fix` the QA-failure comment is already in-thread, so re-dispatching is
 *   the fix). `qa-review`/`approve`/`comment` have no dashboard executor
 *   (per cto.md, approve is a human merge gate) — they surface read-only so
 *   approving can never silently post the wrong command.
