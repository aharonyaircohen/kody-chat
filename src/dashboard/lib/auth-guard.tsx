/**
 * @fileType component

 *
 * AuthGuard — historically redirected to `/login` when no PAT was saved.
 * With the login route removed, gating now lives inside `KodyDashboard`
 * itself: it preserves the chrome (header + chat rail) and renders the
 * `<RepoManager />` empty-state in the task pane when no credentials
 * exist. This component is kept as a passthrough so its call sites stay
 * stable, and so the loading flash during auth hydration is centralised.
