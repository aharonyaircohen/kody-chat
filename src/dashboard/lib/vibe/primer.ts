/**
 * @fileType utility
 * @domain vibe
 * @pattern primer
 * @ai-summary Server-only addendum prepended to the user's message when the
 *   dashboard sends `vibeMode: true` (from /vibe). The engine's
 *   CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT stays untouched — this primer is injected into the
 *   conversation context so we can iterate on the wording in seconds
 *   without republishing @kody-ade/kody-engine. The chat client never
 *   shows this text; it lives only in the session file / runner stdin.
 *
 *   Two variants:
 *   - fresh: no taskContext — "create new issue, branch, PR."
 *   - follow-up: taskContext has issueNumber (and ideally prNumber + branch)
 *     — "push commits to the existing branch; do not create a new issue."
 *
 *   Both the one-shot dispatch path (/api/kody/chat/trigger) and the
 *   long-lived runner path (/api/kody/chat/interactive/append) import from
 *   here so the wording stays in sync.
