/**
 * @fileoverview Reproduction + regression test for the "vibe handoff runs but
 * nothing happens / chat sits silent" bug.
 * @testFramework vitest
 * @domain vibe
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE (found from real session files): the handoff writes the runner's
 * session JSONL in TWO separate GitHub writes — `/interactive/start` writes
 * the meta line, then `/interactive/append` writes the first user turn. Those
 * two writes race on the same file/branch HEAD, and the append's turn is
 * frequently lost — the session ends up meta-only. The runner then boots,
 * finds no turn, waits, and idle-exits with turnsCompleted:0. The chat shows
 * a "processing…" spinner the whole time, so it looks stuck and the task
 * never runs.
 *
 * FIX: let `/interactive/start` write the meta line AND the first user turn in
 * ONE atomic file write, so the runner always sees the kickoff turn on its
 * first read — no second write to race with.
 *
 * This test drives the start route with an initial `content` and asserts the
 * committed session file contains the user turn. It fails on the old route
 * (meta-only) and passes once start writes the turn atomically.
