# Kody Dashboard — Operations UI

Next.js dashboard for monitoring and managing the Kody CI/CD pipeline.

## Architecture

- **Pages** (`app/`) — Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- **Components** (`src/dashboard/lib/components/`) — React UI components
- **Hooks** (`src/dashboard/lib/hooks/`) — Custom React hooks
- **Auth** (`src/dashboard/lib/auth/`) — GitHub OAuth authentication
- **API** (`app/api/kody/`) — Backend API routes for GitHub, tasks, chat, pipelines

## Quick Commands

### Development

- `pnpm dev` — Start dashboard at http://localhost:3333
- `pnpm build` — Build for production
- `pnpm typecheck` — Type check
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` — Lint
- `pnpm format:check` / `pnpm format` — Format

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `KODY_SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | JWT session signing secret |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | GitHub API token (needs `workflows: write`) |
| `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | GitHub OAuth App client ID |
| `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | GitHub OAuth App client secret |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` | Dev | Public URL for OAuth redirects |
| `KODY_CHAT_WORKFLOW_REPO` | No | Central engine repo for chat (default: the connected repo from login) |
| `KODY_CHAT_WORKFLOW_ID` | No | Chat workflow file name (default: `kody.yml`) |
| `JINA_API_KEY` | No | Jina Reader key for the `fetch_url` tool (falls back to anonymous tier) |

## Secrets vault (`/secrets`)

Dashboard-managed alternative to Vercel env vars. Each connected repo has
its own encrypted blob at `.kody/secrets.enc`. Values written via the
`/secrets` page are AES-256-GCM-encrypted with a key derived via HKDF
from `KODY_SESSION_SECRET` (no extra env var) and committed to the repo.
Runtime code reads them via [`getSecret`](src/dashboard/lib/vault/get-secret.ts),
which falls through to `process.env` when the vault is missing or
unconfigured.

- Crypto: [src/dashboard/lib/vault/crypto.ts](src/dashboard/lib/vault/crypto.ts)
- Store (read/write + 60s cache): [src/dashboard/lib/vault/store.ts](src/dashboard/lib/vault/store.ts)
- API: [app/api/kody/secrets/route.ts](app/api/kody/secrets/route.ts), [app/api/kody/secrets/[name]/route.ts](app/api/kody/secrets/[name]/route.ts)
- UI: [src/dashboard/lib/components/SecretsManager.tsx](src/dashboard/lib/components/SecretsManager.tsx)

**Rotation gotcha:** rotating `KODY_SESSION_SECRET` invalidates every
encrypted secret in the vault — back up the values first. Engine
workflows (`kody.yml`) are unchanged and still read from GitHub Actions
secrets; the vault is dashboard-runtime only.

## GitHub webhooks (push-based cache invalidation)

To replace polling with push, the dashboard receives webhooks from GitHub
and invalidates its in-memory cache when resources change. **No shared
secret needed.** The receiver verifies the source IP against GitHub's
published webhook CIDR ranges (`https://api.github.com/meta`); deliveries
from anywhere else return 403.

- IP verification: [src/dashboard/lib/webhooks/github-ip.ts](src/dashboard/lib/webhooks/github-ip.ts)
  — fetches and caches the CIDR list for 24h, with IPv4/IPv6 matching.
- Receiver: [app/api/webhooks/github/route.ts](app/api/webhooks/github/route.ts)
  — verifies IP, dedupes by `X-GitHub-Delivery`, dispatches to
  `invalidateIssueCache` / `invalidatePRCache` / `invalidateWorkflowCache`
  / `invalidateBranchCache` based on event type.
- Registrar: [src/dashboard/lib/webhooks/register.ts](src/dashboard/lib/webhooks/register.ts)
  — shared `ensureWebhook` helper. Idempotent: lists existing hooks on the
  repo and PATCHes the matching one or creates a new one. Caller's PAT
  must have `admin:repo_hook` (the classic `repo` scope already includes it).
  - Auto-called from the OAuth callback ([app/api/oauth/github/callback/route.ts](app/api/oauth/github/callback/route.ts))
    after session creation. Fire-and-forget; failure does not block login.
  - Manual endpoint: [app/api/webhooks/register/route.ts](app/api/webhooks/register/route.ts)
    for re-running registration without re-logging-in.

Subscribed events: `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request`,
`pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `workflow_run`,
`workflow_job`, `check_run`, `check_suite`, `push`, `create`, `delete`.

Invalidation only affects the receiving Vercel instance — other instances
serve cached data until their TTL expires (by design, as a backstop).
Follow-up: swap the in-memory cache for Vercel's Data Cache (`fetch` +
`revalidateTag`) for cross-instance invalidation without adding a database.

## Chat flow

The dashboard has **three** chat backends, picked by the UI's `selectedAgentId`
(default `'kody'`, see [KodyChat.tsx](src/dashboard/lib/components/KodyChat.tsx)).
Don't assume "the chat" means the engine — most user traffic hits the in-process
Gemini path.

| `selectedAgentId` | Endpoint | Backend | System prompt lives in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kody` (**default**) | [`/api/kody/chat/kody`](app/api/kody/chat/kody/route.ts) | In-process Gemini via `@ai-sdk/google` | [`src/dashboard/lib/agents.ts`](src/dashboard/lib/agents.ts) (`AGENT_KODY.systemPrompt`) |
| `brain` | [`/api/kody/chat/brain`](app/api/kody/chat/brain/route.ts) | External Brain chat server (proxied) | Brain server profile (out of repo) |
| anything else | [`/api/kody/chat/trigger`](app/api/kody/chat/trigger/route.ts) | GitHub Actions + `@kody-ade/kody-engine` | `kody2/src/chat/loop.ts` (`CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) |

The legacy `/api/kody/chat` endpoint is deprecated and returns 410.

**Engine path details** (when used): dispatches `kody.yml` in the connected
repo with the session ID and an inline HMAC token in `dashboardUrl`. The kody
engine runs `kody dispatch`, which branches to the chat executable, streams
events back to `/api/kody/events/ingest` (real-time), and commits them to
`.kody/events/{sessionId}.jsonl` (durable fallback, polled by
`/api/kody/events/stream`). Token is verified via HMAC of sessionId with
`KODY_SESSION_SECRET` — no shared DB lookup.

## Deployment

### Production URL

https://kody-aguy.vercel.app

### Vercel CLI

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"  # macOS fix for node path
vercel --prod  # Deploy to production
```

### OAuth Setup

The GitHub OAuth App callback URL must match:

```
https://kody-aguy.vercel.app/api/oauth/github/callback
```

## Import Aliases

```typescript
import { ... } from '@dashboard/...'    // src/dashboard/
import { ... } from '@/...'             // src/
```

## GitHub API rate-limit rules (do not break)

The polling token is shared across all dashboard users (5000 REST req/hr per
token). When the budget is drained the entire dashboard goes dark — the same
window that just blew up takes ~1 hour to reset. Every cache miss matters.

These rules are load-bearing — past regressions of any of them have caused
multi-hour outages. Read [src/dashboard/lib/github-client.ts](src/dashboard/lib/github-client.ts) before changing anything in this file.

1. **Never add `noCache: true` to a polled endpoint to "fix staleness."**
   Bypassing the cache turns every poll into a fresh GitHub call. To make
   data feel fresh, use one of:
   - Lower `ttl` (e.g. `ttl: 15_000`) — post-TTL revalidation is a free 304
     via `If-None-Match` when nothing changed.
   - `invalidateIssueCache(issueNumber)` after writes that mutate that issue
     or a manifest stored in it.
   - Client-side optimistic `setQueryData` for the writer's own UI.

2. **Every `fetchIssue` / `fetchIssues` cache miss must go through the
   ETag/`If-None-Match` path.** A cache miss with no ETag = a full read
   against the budget. With an ETag, GitHub returns 304 (free) when the
   resource is unchanged. Don't strip the `headers: { 'If-None-Match': ... }`
   plumbing.

3. **New GraphQL queries on the polling path need three things:**
   in-process cache (with TTL ≥ 60s for low-churn data), in-flight request
   dedup, and a stale fallback that *refreshes the cache TTL on error* so
   GraphQL throttling doesn't compound. See `fetchOpenPRs` for the pattern.
   GraphQL has its own 5000-points/hr bucket and no ETag/304 escape hatch.

4. **Polling cadence ≥ 15s on any endpoint that touches GitHub.**
   Faster polling forces a token bucket reset to drain instantly when all
   tabs reconnect, restarting the 1-hour wait.

5. **After every write that mutates an issue, call `invalidateIssueCache(n)`.**
   Same-instance reads then see the change immediately without waiting for
   TTL — and without forcing every reader to bypass the cache.
